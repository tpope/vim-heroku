USAGE                                           *heroku* *:Hk*

:Hk [args]              Run hk or heroku with the given [args] using
			|:Dispatch| (or |:make| if unavailable).  If both
			commands are installed, hk is used for known hk
			commands and plugins, and heroku is used for
			everything else.  Tab completion is for hk only.

:Hk run [args]		Identical to :Hk above, but uses |:Start| (or |:!| if
			unavailable).

When editing a file in a Git repository, every Heroku remote from that
repository is camel cased and turned into a :Hk command wrapper that passes
the appropriate app argument.  For example, if you have a remote named staging
pointed at git@heroku.com:myapp-staging.git, calling :Staging restart is
equivalent to calling :Hk restart -a myapp-staging.
